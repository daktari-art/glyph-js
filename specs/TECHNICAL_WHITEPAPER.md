# Glyph.js Technical Whitepaper

## Problem Space
Current debugging tools operate at the WRONG abstraction level:
- Console.log: Too low-level
- Breakpoints: Stop execution flow
- DevTools: Show DOM, not business logic
- No tools visualize DATA FLOW through complex async pipelines

## Innovation
Glyph.js introduces "Execution Visualization" - mapping code execution as visual data flow graphs in real-time.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Execution Interception Layer
```javascript
// Monitors without breaking execution
Glyph.intercept(functionCall, {
    capture: ['args', 'return', 'errors', 'timing'],
    visualize: 'data-flow-graph',
    track: 'async-chains'
});
```

2. Data Flow Graph Engine

· Builds real-time execution graphs
· Tracks data transformations
· Maps async operation dependencies
· Detects race conditions visually

3. Time-Travel Debugging

· Record execution states
· Replay with different data
· Visualize "what changed when"

Competitive Advantage

Unlike existing tools that show WHAT broke, Glyph shows:

· HOW data flowed to the breakpoint
· WHY async operations interleaved badly
· WHERE business logic diverged from expected
· WHEN state became inconsistent

```
